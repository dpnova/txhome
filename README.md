An opinion on home automation. One that suits me :)


### So...

Basically a twisted app for manage all things in the home, and my daily workflow.


Things to add:

* Sonos support:  https://github.com/SoCo/SoCo
* Pivotal tracker support
* Hue support: http://www.developers.meethue.com/
* integrations with my solar power readings (need 433mhtz rx)
